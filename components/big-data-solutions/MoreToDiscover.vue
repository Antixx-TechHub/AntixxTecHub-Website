                                support imperative for any business are- volume, variety, and velocity. The Big Data
                                volume depends upon the speed at which the intended information is collected and
                                processed. The Big Data variety is the diversity in the used sources, targeted devices
                                and collected information. Big Data velocity denotes how fast information is being
                                extracted for the particular purpose.</p>
